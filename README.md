# Pynntt - Python Native Network Theory Tools

The project offers tools useful in studying network theory. We build from a core that is a two-pole transformerless network (on-port, two-terminal RLC-network) descriptor language. We provide tools to read and write these descriptors, enumerate them, and analyse analyse and classify both their functional (driving point immittance, regularity, essential regularity f.e.) and structural properties (Simple Series Parallel (SSP), f.e.).

We define our structural descriptor grammar with a view it evaloving over time to include descriptors for three-poles and four-poles, as well as related functional descriptors for two-ports and n-ports, and structureal interconnects to compose then into larger structurs, and decompose into different forms.
