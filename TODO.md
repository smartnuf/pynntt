# pynntt TODO List

This file contains a list of tasks and items to be addressed for the `pynntt` project.

## High Priority

*   Implement `is_rational_function()` and `is_positive_real_function()`. These are needed in some `is_necessarily_regular_*()` predicates, as a function has no classification for regularity unless it is a positive real, rational, function.
*   Add test cases for boundary values of the algebraic conditions for regularity of quadratic forms, and create conditions for each reachable set of values of sigma, delta, and lambdaN.

## Medium Priority

*   Extend the strategy (mathematics) used in `is_necessarily_regular_biquadratic()` to functions supporting higher-order systems, specifically at least 3rd-order systems where the algebraic sets are symbolically tractable.

## Low Priority
