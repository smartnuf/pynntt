# pynntt TODO List

This file contains a list of tasks and items to be addressed for the `pynntt` project.

## High Priority

*   [DONE] Implement `is_positive_real_rational_function()` as a placeholder 
    that only checks if it's a rational function.
*   Fix top level is_regular test -- it needs its own set of exptectations.
*   Reformat code to adhere to line length limits and add newlines at end of 
    files.
*   [DONE] Add test cases for boundary values of the algebraic conditions for 
    regularity of quadratic forms, and create conditions for each reachable 
    set of values of sigma, delta, and lambdaN.
*   Implement `is_positive_real_rational_function()`

## Medium Priority

*   Extend the strategy (mathematics) used in 
   `is_necessarily_regular_biquadratic()` to functions supporting 
    higher-order systems, specifically at least 3rd-order systems where the 
    algebraic sets are symbolically tractable.

## Low Priority
